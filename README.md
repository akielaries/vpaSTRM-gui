# Introduction
WIP repo using opencv, flask and ngrok with python to stream feeds
of RTSP based cameras with future implementation of GUI in the works.

> :warning: *This repo is forked from [here](https://github.com/DiscoverCCRI/ip_cam) and serves
as a "new version" also developed by [me](https://github.com/akielaries), building off of the application
used for the DiscoverCCRI research study. This project will be open source and welcomes contributors.*


# Ideas
- think of different py libs to implement GUI, PyQt, Tkinter, etc
- maybe implement my own, if going for speed and effeciency lets write it in C!
- modularize what ever the final result is for the demo into something usable
for an application. 
- if we are using C, research how to a C-based GUI can talk with our existing python
implementations.
- research using GTK with C
- Research using curses (terminal-based GUI)
- hash out the issues with buffering on our test cams
